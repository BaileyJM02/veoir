# 3.1 Analysis of the problem
To-do:

- [ ] Identified suitable stakeholders for the project and described them explaining how they will make use of the proposed solution and why it is appropriate to their needs.
- [ ] Researched the problem in depth looking at existing solutions to similar problems, identifying and justifying suitable approaches based on this research.
- [ ] Identified the essential features of the proposed computational solution explaining these choices.
- [ ] Identified and explained with justification any limitations of the proposed solution.
- [ ] Specified and justified the requirements for the solution including (as appropriate) any hardware and software requirements.
- [ ] Identified and justified measurable success criteria for the proposed solution.

Notes:
- A brief, succinct description of your project, what you will do
- Explain why the project needs to be completed by a computer
- **Research** – lots of research (all poor projects fail here) – this is where you go and find out HOW TO DO YOUR PROJECT!! I cannot emphasise this enough. In this section you'll need to find out how other people have - solved similar problems and use this to justify your approach.
- Success criteria
- Hardware and software requirements
- Testing strategy this makes it really
